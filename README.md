# Faux Cart
Faux Cart is a vanilla JavaScript project for adding fake shopping cart functionality to static HTML websites. It uses the localStorage API to mimic server side behaviours.

This project was written to be understood and customised by individuals new to foundational web languages.

This initial release features the ability to add and remove items from a cart, the ability to retrieve and view the cart contents, remove items from the cart, and empty the cart.

A mock 'checkout' process may be added a a later date as time permits.
